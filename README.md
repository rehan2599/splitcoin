# Splitcoin: Buy Products with Crypto Installments

## Project Overview

Our marketplace is an innovative platform that allows users to purchase products using sBTC (Synthetic Bitcoin) or STX (Stacks) cryptocurrencies. The unique feature of this marketplace is the ability to pay for purchases in installments, taking advantage of potential price increases in these cryptocurrencies.

## Key Features

1. **Cryptocurrency Payments**: Accept payments in sBTC and STX, leveraging the Stacks blockchain's capabilities.

2. **Installment Plans**: Users can split their payments into 5 monthly installments, potentially benefiting from cryptocurrency price appreciation.

3. **Smart Contract Integration**: The marketplace is powered by smart contracts deployed on the Hiro testnet, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use platform for browsing products, connecting wallets, and managing purchases.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Stacks (testnet)
- **Smart Contracts**: Deployed on Hiro testnet
- **Cryptocurrencies**: sBTC and STX
- **Wallets**: Compatible with Stacks wallets (e.g., Hiro, Xverse)

## Important Notes

- Ensure you have sufficient sBTC or STX balance in your wallet before initiating the transaction.
- The installment option allows you to potentially benefit from Bitcoin price appreciation, but also carries the risk of price decreases.
- Transaction fees will likely be paid in STX, even if using sBTC for the purchase.
- Always verify you are using a legitimate marketplace that properly integrates with the Stacks blockchain before connecting your wallet or making purchases.

By using sBTC and STX for purchases, you're participating in an emerging Bitcoin-based economy enabled by Stacks technology.
